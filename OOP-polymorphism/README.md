Polymorphism: Refers to perform a certain action in different ways. Overloading and overriding are a polymorphism style.
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.<br>
Polymorphism in Java:<br>
•	The same method name is used several times.<br>
•	All Java objects can be considered polymorphic (at the minimum, they are of their own type and instances of the Object class).<br>
•	Example of static polymorphism(that occurs at compile time) in Java is method overloading.<br>
•	Example of dynamic polymorphism(that occurs at runtime) in Java is method overriding.<br>
