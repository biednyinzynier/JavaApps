Polymorphism: Refers to perform a certain action in different ways. Overloading and overriding are a polymorphism style. <br>
Polymorphism in Java:<br>
•	The same method name is used several times.<br>
•	Different methods of the same name can be called from the object.<br>
•	All Java objects can be considered polymorphic (at the minimum, they are of their own type and instances of the Object class).<br>
•	Example of static polymorphism in Java is method overloading.<br>
•	Example of dynamic polymorphism in Java is method overriding.<br>
