<h2>Polymorphism:</h2> 
Refers to perform a certain action in different ways. Overloading and overriding are a polymorphism style.
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.<br>
<h3>Polymorphism in Java:</h3>
•	The same method name is used several times.<br>
•	All Java objects can be considered polymorphic (at the minimum, they are of their own type and instances of the Object class).<br>
•	Example of static polymorphism(that occurs at compile time) in Java is method overloading because method binding between method call and method definition happens at compile time and it depends on the reference of the class (reference created at compile time and goes to stack).<br>
•	Example of dynamic polymorphism(that occurs at runtime) in Java is method overriding because method binding between method call and method definition happens at run time and it depends on the object of the class (object created at runtime and goes to the heap).<br>
