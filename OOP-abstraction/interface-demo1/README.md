Interfaces: <br>
•	Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. <br>
•	In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. <br>
•	Along with abstraction, interface also helps to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.<br>
•	You can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.<br>
