Abstraction: Aims to hide complexity from the users and show them only the relevant informations.<br>
For example, if you want to turn on the television, you don't need to know about its internal workings. You can just click the button.<br>
The same is true for Java classes. You can hide internal implementation details by using abstract classes or interfaces. <br>
To make abstract, you just need to define method signatures without body and let each class implement them in their own way.<br><br>
Abstraction in Java:<br>
•	Hides the underlying complexity of data<br>
•	Helps avoid repetitive code<br>
•	Gives flexibility to programmers to change the implementation of the abstract behaviour<br>
