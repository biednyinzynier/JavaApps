<h2>Abstract class: </h2>
•	Abstract class in Java contains the ‘abstract’ keyword.<br>
•	What does the abstract keyword mean? If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated, which means you cannot create an object of an abstract class.<br>
•	You can achieve 0-100% abstraction using abstract class.<br>
•	To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class where you have to provide implementations for the abstract methods.
