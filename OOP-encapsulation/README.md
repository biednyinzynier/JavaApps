Encapsulation: Allows us to protect the data stored in a class from public access. 
The encapsulated class is like real-life capsule. 
It restricts direct access to data members(fields) of a class.
Fields are private.
Each field has a getter and setter method.
Getter methods return the field.
Setter methods let us change the field.
