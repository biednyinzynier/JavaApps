Encapsulation: Allows us to protect the data stored in a class from public access.The encapsulated class is like real-life capsule. <br>
•	Restricts direct access to data members (fields) of a class.<br>
•	Fields are set to private<br>
•	Each field has a getter and setter method<br>
•	Getter methods return the field<br>
•	Setter methods let us change the value of the field<br>
