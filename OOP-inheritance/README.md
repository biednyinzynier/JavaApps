<h2>Inheritance:</h2>
Makes it possible to create a child class and inherit the fields and methods of the parent class.<br>
•	A class (child class) can extend another class (parent class) by inheriting its features.<br>
•	Implements the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) programming principle.<br>
•	Improves code reusability.<br>
•	Multilevel inheritance is allowed in Java (a child class can have its own child class as well, like hierarchy).<br>
•	Multiple inheritances are not allowed in Java (a class can’t extend more than one class).<br>
