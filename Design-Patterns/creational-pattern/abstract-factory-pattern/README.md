<h2>Abstract Factory Pattern:</h2>
Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
<h3>Advantage of Abstract Factory Pattern</h3>
o	Abstract Factory Pattern isolates the client code from concrete (implementation) classes.<br>
o	It promotes consistency among objects.
<h3>Usage of Abstract Factory Pattern</h3>
o	When the system needs to be independent of how its object are created and represented.<br>
o	When you want to provide a library of objects that does not show implementations and only reveals interfaces.<br>
o	When the system needs to be configured with one of a multiple family of objects.
