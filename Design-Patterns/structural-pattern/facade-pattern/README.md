<h2>Facade Pattern:</h2>
A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".<br>
In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.
Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.

<h3>Advantage of Facade Pattern</h3>
o	It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.<br>
o	It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

<h3>Usage of Facade Pattern:</h3>
It is used:<br>
o	When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.<br>
o	When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
