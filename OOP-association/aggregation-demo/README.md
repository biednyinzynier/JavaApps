<h2>Aggregation: </h2>
Aggregation is a narrower kind of association. 
It occurs when there’s a one-way (HAS-A) relationship between the two classes you associate through their objects.<br>
<h3>Aggregation in Java:</h3>
•	One-directional association.<br>
•	Represents a HAS-A relationship between two classes.<br>
•	Only one class is dependent on the other.<br><br>
In this example, there is a Faculty which has number of departments like Computer Engineering, E-E. Engineering. 
Every department has number of students. <br>
So, we make a Faculty class which has a reference to Object or number of Objects (List of Objects) of the Department class.
That means Faculty class is associated with Department class through its Object.
And Department class has also a reference to Object or Objects (List of Objects) of Student class 
That mean it is associated with Student class through its Objects.
It represents a Has-A relationship.<br><br>
