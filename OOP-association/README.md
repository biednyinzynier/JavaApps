Association simply means the act of establishing a relationship between two unrelated classes.<br>
For example, when you declare two fields of different types within the same class and make them interact with each other, 
you have performed association.<br>
Association in Java:<br>
•	Two separate classes are associated through their objects.<br>
•	The two classes are unrelated, each can exist without the other one.<br>
•	Can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many relationship.<br>
